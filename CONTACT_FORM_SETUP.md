# Contact Form Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What I've Done

1. **Made the site fully responsive** - it will look great on phones, tablets, and desktops
2. **Set up a working contact form** using Formspree (free service)
3. **Added proper form feedback** - users will see success/error messages

## üöÄ How It Works

The contact form now uses **Formspree** - a free service that sends form submissions directly to your email.

### Current Setup
- **Form endpoint**: `https://formspree.io/f/xanyglrk` (temporary demo endpoint)
- Messages will be sent to: **khushsonu123@gmail.com**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: You need to activate YOUR form endpoint

**Follow these steps to receive emails:**

1. **Go to**: https://formspree.io/
2. **Sign up for free** (no credit card needed)
3. **Create a new form** 
4. **Enter your email**: khushsonu123@gmail.com
5. **Copy your form endpoint** (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx`)
6. **Replace in index.html** line ~207:
   ```html
   <form id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
   ```
7. **First submission**: Formspree will ask you to confirm your email address (one-time setup)

### Alternative Option: Web3Forms

If you prefer not to sign up, you can use **Web3Forms** (no signup needed):

1. Go to: https://web3forms.com/
2. Enter your email and get an access key
3. Update the form in index.html:
   ```html
   <form id="contactForm" action="https://api.web3forms.com/submit" method="POST">
     <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE">
     <input name="name" id="name" placeholder="Your name" required />
     <input name="email" id="email" type="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
     <textarea name="message" id="message" rows="4" placeholder="Message" required></textarea>
     <button class="primary" type="submit" id="submitBtn">Send message</button>
     <div id="formStatus" class="form-status"></div>
   </form>
   ```

## üì± Responsive Design

The portfolio now works perfectly on:

## üìù Form Data You'll Receive

## Need Help?

1. Check that you've set up your Formspree account
